# Predict Student Scores

This project implements a **Simple Linear Regression Model** to predict student scores based on the number of hours they study. The project demonstrates end-to-end machine learning workflows, including data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to explore the relationship between study hours and student scores and to build a regression model that accurately predicts a student's performance.

### Key Features
- **Input Feature**: `Hours` - Number of hours a student studies.
- **Target Variable**: `Scores` - The score a student achieves.

### Dataset
- The dataset contains 25 observations with two columns: `Hours` and `Scores`. 
- No missing values or duplicates were found during data cleaning.
- The dataset was used to train and evaluate the regression model.

## Workflow

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Summary statistics and data types were analyzed.
   - Visualizations included boxplots, scatterplots, histograms, and Q-Q plots to understand the data distribution and relationships.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Checked for missing values and duplicates.
   - Verified the correlation between study hours and scores, confirming a strong positive relationship.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).
   - Trained a **Simple Linear Regression Model** using Scikit-learn's `LinearRegression`.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the model using metrics such as:
     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
     - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
     - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
     - **RÂ² Score**

## Results

The model achieved the following performance on the test dataset:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 18.94
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: 4.35
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 3.92
- **RÂ² Score**: 0.968  

An RÂ² value of **0.968** indicates that the model explains 96.8% of the variability in the scores based on the hours studied, demonstrating an excellent fit.
